      Storybooth is a phone booth in Montgomery, AL providing an inclusive, equitable opportunity for sharing, listening, and storytelling.
      Participants may use it at any time to tell their story, which is then uploaded to public archive for all to hear.
      Through the use of transcription and text analysis, a collective narrative picture will emerge offering a deeper understanding of our collective selves—of  memory, of “place,” and of the love, pain, and hope that binds people together.

  - title: ScreenLinks
    text: >
      ScreenLinks in an experiment to create concert or event visuals that audiences can easily play with from their phone’s web browser and collectively share on a large screen.
      The project aimed to give audience members a more personal way to connect with and influence a performance by providing controls that could be used at any time.
      Iterations of this project include a Space Invaders-style game that let players activate concert visuals, a drawing tool for Georgia State’s CMII Opening Day, and a multiplayer game for the Chemistry advertising agency.
